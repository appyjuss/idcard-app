# Technical TODO List

## High Priority

### ID Card Generation Worker
- [ ] Implement actual ID card generation logic in worker.js: [Backend] [Core] [Image Processing]
  - Load template SVG/image from `jobRecord.server_template_path`
  - Load photo from `path.join(jobRecord.server_photos_unzip_path, cardRecord.photo_identifier)`
  - Use 'sharp' library to:
    - Resize/crop photo as needed
    - Composite photo onto template
    - Add text from cardRecord.card_data (name, title, etc.)
  - Save the output file with proper naming convention
